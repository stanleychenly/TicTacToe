# TicTacToe
A Tic Tac Toe Artificial Intelligence using pure Python, no frameworks.

The goal of this project is to learn Minimax and the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm through my own ability to code. After attempting to build it, I will look at how the MCTS actually works and learn it the proper way. How I will do this is through an iterative approach where I will make changes day by day so I can see the process of how the code evolves.

Learning like this will help things stick better as I will be able to appreciate the optimal way more once I've tried it myself. This will also help me truely learn it rather than trying to memorize a tutorial off YouTube.

I've made a list of days where I will make incremental updates to the project: 

Day 01 - Create a Tic Tac Toe game that has works with all the rules

Day 02 - Create a simulation of an unintelligent AI that plays against itself

Day 03 - Modify it so that a user can play against an unintelligent AI

Day 04 - Create a win and loss algorithm so the AI can see immediate wins and losses on their current turn

Day 05 - Create a tree where the AI can see all the possible board positions from the beginning of the game and can't lose (Minimax)

Day 06 - Create step 1 of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (Selection)

Day 07 - Create step 2 of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (Expansion)

Day 08 - Create step 3 of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (Simulation)

Day 09 - Create step 4 of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (Back Propagation)

Day 10 - Create an external database of win conditions that can be accessed by the algorithm

Day 11 - Attempt to create a neural network on the data from the external database

Day 12 - Learn how others created the Tic Tac Toe game and reflect on what could be done better

Day 13 - Learn how others created Minimax and reflect on what could be done better

Day 14 - Learn how others created the Monte Carlo tree search and reflect on what could be done better

Day 15 - Learn about neural networks
