# TicTacToe
A Tic Tac Toe Artificial Intelligence using pure Python.

The goal of this project is to learn the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm through my own ability to code. After attempting to build it, I will look at how the MCTS actually works and learn it the proper way. 

Learning like this will help things stick better as I will be able to appreciate the optimal way more once I've tried it myself. This will also help me truely learn it rather than trying to memorize a tutorial off YouTube.
